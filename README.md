- Pro features - TBD

## Related Work (past years)

We are discussing here only about the repositories we had access to in order to make a fair assessment.

### TBD
- IoT eHealth
- Car sharing system

### Migration Reporting Tool (Birds)

```
    Migration Reporting Tool (Birds) - real-time generation of interactive map regading the migrations performed by various entities
    
    What can be done/improved:
    - lack of PRO features
    - lack of integration with data analysis tools for frontend
    - lack of authentication and authorization methods
    - lack of history for searches
    - lack of versioning at API level
    - queries hardcoded -> possibility to make an SQL Injection
    - usage of SQL in a context in which documents may vary in what concernes existing fields
    - no clusterisation methods to augment data in documents 
    
    What we appreciated:
    - usage of cos similarity as an own implementation
    - intuitive frontend
    - performance tests
```

### Fake News in Real Time

```
    Fake News in Real Time - deciding the trustworthiness of news
    
    What can be done/improved:
    - lack of PRO features
    - lack of auth layer

    What we appreciated:
        - built according to users' needs as the level of min accepted credibility can be adjusted (-> these rates can be mapped into our algorithm for alerts regarding the health status of components)
        - linking the resource with the pro/con arguments (other resources known by the application) (mapped into history in our application which proves the direction in which the health status of the component evolves)
        - usage of caching methods for faster responses (caching on both frontend and backend)
        - usage of mature library for large text analysis and finding similarities (training our model to get a good accuracy)
```

### IoT in medical domain
```
    IoT in medical domain
    What can be done/improved:
        - lack of PRO features
        - lack of data Encryption
        - lack of versioning at API level

    What we appreciated:
        - ability to contact the doctor from the application
        - automatic alerts in case of an health emergency
        - performance tests
```

### Smart City
```
    Smart City
    What can be done/improved:
        - lack of PRO features
        - lack of data Encryption
        - lack of tests

    What we appreciated:
        - ease of adding new services
        - use of microservices
        - available on both Android and Web 
```

### State of Art - TBD

```
    On the theme set by the scientific coordinator you make the state-of-the-art (a document (1/2 pages per team member), which to put on GoogleDocs/GitHub/Bitbucket/etc., in English with):  
        • What did the others, techniques and methodologies used, evaluation methods, results; 
        • Important names in the field, research teams;  • Related Articles and books; 
        • Relevant links; 
        • Resources and tools available. 
```

### Papers IoT related - TBD - probably in state of art

### Risk Assessment - TBD
